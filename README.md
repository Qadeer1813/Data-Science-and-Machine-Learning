# Project Description
The purpose of this project is to predict the Birth to Death ratio in regions. I used linear regression to plot the graph. 

# Data Source
The dataset that was used for this project can be downloaded from https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/MostUsed/ 

# Processing
After downloading the dataset I selected the columns I would be using for my Linear Regression. The first step is to load the data. Next I filtered the ```Type``` column by ```Region```. I then conducted a test print ```region_data.head()```.
I seleected the ```Region, subregion, country or area *``` ```Year```, ```Births (thousands)```, ```Total Deaths (thousands)``` columns which will be used to filter out the Name of the region, Years, Births, and Deaths. I proceeded to run another print on this
to view the data rows that would be used for plotting. I began to clean any numeric values to remove spaces and commas from the ```Births (thousands)```, ```Total Deaths (thousands)``` columns. I printed the data again. I converted
the columns to numeric and handled any errors. I then divided the ```Births (thousands)```, ```Total Deaths (thousands)``` columns to get the Birth to death ratio. For example, In 1950 Africa ```Births (thousands)```: 10879 / ```Total Deaths (thousands)```: 6126 = Births to Death Ratio = 1.775873

# Data Understanding and Visualisation 
The dataset for this project gives the estimates of all Regions, Subregions and Country/Area. The population, Fertility, Mortality and Migration. After processing for regions and the Fertility Birth Rates and Mortality Death reaths,
I got the Birth to Death Ratio of the different regions from 1950-2023. 

After processing data for the Birth To Death Ratio, this was the plotted graph:

This image shows all the regions of the world and their Birth to Death Ratio in coloured format from 1950-2023.

To get the specific Birth to Death Ratio for certain Regions, I added code which would take a Year and a Subregion specified by the user. Using the existing ```cleaned_data``` I was able to plot the the Ratio's on the graph.

For example:

This plotted Birth to Death Ratio was for Africa and by looking at the Regression line we are able to predict what the futrue Birth rate would be for Africa. 

# Algorithims:
Linear regression model is applied to the data. This model is trained on th exisiting dataset which for us is the Years and there calculated Birth to Death Ratio. 
Once the model was traind we can start predicting future for different regions.
