**Linear Regression**

# Project Description
The purpose of this project is to predict the Birth to Death ratio in regions. Linear regression was used to plot the graph. 

# Data Source
The dataset that was used for this project can be downloaded from https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/MostUsed/ 

# Processing
After downloading the dataset, columns were selected for Linear Regression. Data was loaded and the ```Type``` column by ```Region``` was filtered. A test print was conducted using this code ```region_data.head()```. 
The ```Region, subregion, country or area *``` ```Year```, ```Births (thousands)```, ```Total Deaths (thousands)``` were selected. These columns were used to filter out the Name of the region, Years, Births, and Deaths. Another print was run
to view the data rows that would be used for plotting. Numeric values were cleaned to remove spaces and commas from the ```Births (thousands)```, ```Total Deaths (thousands)``` columns. Data was printed again and converted
the columns to numeric and handled any errors. The ```Births (thousands)```, ```Total Deaths (thousands)``` columns were divided to get the Birth to death ratio. For example, In 1950 Africa ```Births (thousands)```: 10879 / ```Total Deaths (thousands)```: 6126 = Births to Death Ratio = 1.775873

# Data Understanding and Visualisation 
The dataset for this project gives the estimates of all Regions, Subregions and Country/Area. The population, Fertility, Mortality and Migration. After processing for regions and the Fertility Birth Rates and Mortality Death rates,
The Birth to Death Ratio was created for the different regions from 1950-2023. 

This was the plotted graph, after processing data for the Birth To Death Ratio:

This image shows all the regions of the world and their Birth to Death Ratio in coloured format from 1950-2023.

To get the specific Birth to Death Ratio for certain Regions, Code was implemented which would take a Year and a Subregion specified by the users choice. One can plot the ratio on the graph using the existing ```cleaned_data```.
For example:

This plotted Birth to Death Ratio was for Africa. 
One can predict what the future Birth to Death rate would be for Africa using the Regression line. 

# Algorithims:
Linear regression model is applied to the data. This model is trained on the years and there calculated Birth to Death Ratio. 
Once the model was trained we can start predicting the future for different regions.
