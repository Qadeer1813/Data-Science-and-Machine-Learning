**Linear Regression**

# Project Description
The purpose of this project is to prediuct the Birth to Death ratio in regions using Linear Regression I was able to plot the graph.

# Data Source
The dataset that was used for this project can be downloaded from https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/MostUsed/ 

# Pre-Processing
After downloading the the data I need to clean it. The first thing was to load the data which was done by reading in the csv. Next I filtered the ```Type```
