# Project Description
The purpose of this project is to prediuct the Birth to Death ratio in regions using Linear Regression I was able to plot the graph.

# Data Source
The dataset that was used for this project can be downloaded from https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/MostUsed/ 

# Processing
After downloading the data I needed to select which column I would be uing for my Linear Regression it. The first thing was to load the data which was done by reading in the csv. Next I filtered the ```Type``` column by ```Region```. I then did a test print ```region_data.head()```.
After doing this I seleected the ```Region, subregion, country or area *``` ```Year```, ```Births (thousands)```, ```Total Deaths (thousands)``` columns which I will be using to filter out the Name of the region, Years, Births, and Deaths. I prceeded to run another print on this
to view the data rows that would be used for plotting. I then started cleaning the data, first stated cleaning any numeric values to remove spaces and commas from the ```Births (thousands)```, ```Total Deaths (thousands)``` columns. I printed the data again. In te same column I converted
the columns to numeric and handled any errors. I then divided the ```Births (thousands)```, ```Total Deaths (thousands)``` columns to get the Birth to death ratio. An example In 1950 Africa ```Births (thousands)```: 10879 / ```Total Deaths (thousands)```: 6126 = Births to Death Ratio = 1.775873

# Data Understanding and Visualisation 
The dataset for this project gives the estimates of all Regions, Subregions and Country/Area. The population, Fertility, Mortality and Migration. As I did the pre processing for regions and the Fertility Birth Rates and Mortality Death reaths o get the Borth to death ratio of the regins. 
After doing the processing the data for the birth to death ratio this was the following result:
